Git Branch Merge & Pull Request Guide
1. Push Your Branch to GitHub
Before merging, ensure your branch exists on GitHub:
 git branch # Check current branch
 git checkout branch-name # Switch to your branch
 git push origin branch-name # Push branch to GitHub
2. Update 'main' Locally
Switch to 'main' and pull latest changes:
 git checkout main
 git pull origin main
3. Merge Your Branch into 'main' (Optional - Direct Merge via CLI)
 git merge branch-name
 git push origin main
Note: This skips the review process. Use only if you are sure.
4. Create a Pull Request on GitHub
Steps:
 1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
 2. Click 'Compare & Pull Request'.
 3. Set base branch to 'main' and compare branch to your branch.
 4. Add a title and description.
 5. Click 'Create Pull Request'.
 6. Review changes and click 'Merge Pull Request'.
5. Delete the Branch After Merge (Optional)
 git branch -d branch-name
 git push origin --delete branch-name
Example:
 git push origin feature/login
 git checkout main
 git pull origin main
 git merge feature/login
 git push origin main
